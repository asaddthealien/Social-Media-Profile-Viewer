     <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a group of four students--<b>Syed Ashar Tahir, Ahmed Nadir Shah, Bilal Ahmed, and Asad Ullah bin Tufail</b>--on a mission to survive the rigorous yet rewarding environment of FAST.<br>
        While academia challenges us daily, we&#39;ve found camaraderie in shared struggles, laughter in late-night group studies, and a sense of achievement in each milestone we conquer together.
        For our ICT project, we&#39;ve designed a Social Profile Viewer.<br><br>
        It&#39;s an ambitious attempt to streamline how users can access and manage social profiles, and we hope it delivers on its potential (fingers crossed).<br>
        This project reflects our teamwork and resilience, as well as our desire to create something meaningful within the constraints of time and resources.
        Beyond this, life as FASTians has been a rollercoaster.<br><br>
        From the chaos of managing assignments and quizzes to celebrating small wins like a good cup of chai during breaks, every day adds something memorable to our journey.<br>
        Each of us brings a unique vibe to the group, be it Syed Ashar&#39;s focus, Ahmed Nadir&#39;s humor, Bilal&#39;s creativity, or Asad Ullah&#39;s determination.
        While we haven&#39;t done anything groundbreaking yet, our journey has been about growth, shared experiences, and finding balance in the whirlwind of academic and personal commitments.<br>
        This project is a reflection of our effort to make our mark, however small it might be, and we hope it resonates with anyone who interacts with it.
        
        Here&#39;s to learning, improving, and survivingâ€”together!
